# ZinoEngine

A custom C++ 3d vulkan only (for now) game engine that I make for fun.

# Build

For now only VS2019 is supported, but if you want you can try to build it for other compilers.

- Run BuildLibs.bat to compile 3rd party libs
- Run GenerateVS2019.bat to generate the solution and project files
- Open the solution in Build/ProjectFiles and build it

Only Debug is implemented for now.
